📄 Project Description
This project, RFID_ESP8266_Interface_by_ReponSheikh, demonstrates how to interface an MFRC522 RFID module with an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) to read RFID tag UIDs and display them on the Serial Monitor. It's designed as a beginner-friendly, IoT-ready system for learning about RFID technology and ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontrollers.

This setup can be the foundation for more advanced applications like access control, attendance systems, and smart door locks.

🛠️ Features:
Reads RFID card/tag UID using MFRC522

Displays UID via Serial Monitor

Works with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

Simple, low-cost setup

Can be extended to IoT/web integration

🔧 Components Used:
ESP8266 NodeMCU (ESP-12E or similar)

MFRC522 RFID module

RFID tags/cards

Jumper wires

Breadboard or custom PCB

📷 Circuit Diagram:
A diagram image is included in the repository.

🚀 Getting Started:
Connect the MFRC522 to ESP8266 (refer to the circuit diagram)

Upload the provided code using Arduino IDE

Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud rate)

Scan any RFID card or tag to see its UID printed on the screen
